# Basic Natural Language Processing Workflow

A Jupyter Notebook that performs Natural Language Processing (NLP) on a piece of text about the design thinking process. 

This code demonstrates a basic NLP workflow for cleaning and analyzing text data. It performs sentence segmentation, tokenization, stop word removal, stemming/lemmatization, part-of-speech tagging, and named entity recognition. 
You can extend this code to perform more complex NLP tasks such as sentiment analysis or topic modeling.
